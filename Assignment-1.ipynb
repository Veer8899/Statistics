    "# There are two type of statistics and they are:\n",
    "### 1. Discreptive Staistics :- It consists of organizing, summarizing data and presenting data in a meaningful and interpretable manner. \n",
    "### Example: Exam Scores in a Class\n",
    "#### Suppose you are a teacher and want to understand the performance of your students on a recent exam. You have collected the scores of 30 students, ranging from 0 to 100. In this scenario, you can use descriptive statistics to summarize and describe the exam scores.\n",
    "### For this we can use:\n",
    "#### >> Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, Median, Mode to determine the average score and the typical score achieved by students. \n",
    "#### >> Measures of Dispersion: To understand the spread or variability of the scores, we can calculate measures such as the range, variance, and standard deviation of the score achieved by the students.\n",
    "#### >> Different Type of Distribution of Data >> We  can create a histogram or a bar chart to visually represent the distribution of exam scores and observe the data. \n",

    "####  Let's consider the same example of exam scores in a class. \n",
    "#### Inferential statistics can be used in this scenario to draw conclusions about the performance of the entire class based on the collected sample data of 30 students.\n",
    "### For this we can use:\n",
    "#### >> Confidence Intervals: By calculating a confidence interval, we can estimate the range within which the average exam score for the entire class is likely to fall. \n",
    "#### >> Hypothesis Testing: By conducting a hypothesis test, such as a one-sample t-test, we can evaluate the evidence and determine if class's performance is significantly different from the reference population.\n",
    "#### >> Comparison of Subgroups: If we have collected additional information about students, such as their gender or study habits, inferential statistics can be employed to compare the performance of different subgroups. \n",
    "#### >> Predictive Analytics: Using inferential statistics, we can develop predictive models to forecast future exam scores or academic performance based on various factors. "

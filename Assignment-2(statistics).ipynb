    "## Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the central tendency of a dataset?\n",
    "#### Mean: The mean is also known as the average and is calculated by adding up all the values in the dataset and dividing the sum by the total number of values. It is sensitive to extreme values and can be affected by outliers. To calculate the mean, we sum up all the values and divide by the number of values in the dataset. The mean is commonly used when the data is normally distributed or approximately symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is not affected by extreme values or outliers, making it a robust measure of central tendency. It is often used when the data contains outliers or is skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mode: The mode is the value or values that occur most frequently in a dataset. In other words, it represents the most common observation. A dataset can have no mode if no value appears more than once, or it can have multiple modes if multiple values have the same highest frequency. The mode is useful for categorical or discrete data, but it can also be used with continuous data."

    "## Q12. For a normal distribution data what is the relationship between its measure of central tendency?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean: The mean, also known as the average, is the measure of central tendency that represents the balancing point of the distribution. In a normal distribution, the mean is located at the exact center of the distribution, and it is equal to the median and mode. Therefore, for a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Median: The median is the middle value in the distribution when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. In a normal distribution, the median is also equal to the mean and mode. This is because the normal distribution is symmetric, with an equal number of values on both sides of the center. As a result, the middle value is the same as the mean and mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mode: The mode represents the values in the distribution that occur with the highest frequency. In a normal distribution, there is a single peak, and the data is symmetrically distributed around the mean. Therefore, the mode is equal to the mean and median."

    "\n",
    "### Measures of Central Tendency: Outliers can heavily influence measures of central tendency such as the mean, median, and mode:\n",
    "#### Mean: The mean is sensitive to extreme values, including outliers. A single extreme value can significantly shift the mean towards that value, distorting the measure of central tendency.\n",
    "#### Median: The median is less affected by outliers compared to the mean. It represents the middle value in a dataset and is less influenced by extreme values.\n",
    "#### Mode: The mode is generally not affected by outliers since it represents the most frequently occurring value(s). Outliers have a minimal impact on the mode unless they occur frequently."

    "### Measures of Dispersion: Outliers can also impact measures of dispersion, such as the range, variance, and standard deviation:\n",
    "#### Range: Outliers, particularly those located at the extremes of the dataset, can substantially expand the range, leading to an overestimated measure of dispersion.\n",
    "#### Variance: Outliers have a notable effect on the variance since it incorporates the squared differences between values and the mean. Outliers with large deviations can significantly increase the variance.\n",
    "#### Standard Deviation: Similar to the variance, the standard deviation is influenced by outliers. It measures the dispersion around the mean, and outliers can contribute to a larger standard deviation."
